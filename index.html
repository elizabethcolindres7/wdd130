          Hello, my name is Elizabeth Colindres and I am from El Salvador, I enjoy listening to music, my favorite artists are Harry Styles and Taylor Swift, and my favorite color is purple, I´m a big fan of the color you should see my water bottle and my phone case. I love pastries that include making them from scratch, going to new places, and trying new things. I love discovering new cafeterias and going out with my friends. I also love being in the church and my callings are the second counselor of the young woman and seminary teacher, which I enjoy. I enjoy it because is fun being with young souls and teaching them Jesus Christ, I needed it when I was this age even though I´m only 2 years old more than most of them I learn from them and they from me, I´m happy for being an instrument on god’s plan. Currently, I work in a call center I spend 10 hours per day and I rest on weekends. On my days off I normally go out with my church or job friends on Saturday and Sunday I go to church read my institute class assignments and also prepare for seminary classes.

        El Salvador is the smallest and most densely populated of the seven Central American countries. Despite having little level land, it traditionally was an agricultural country, heavily dependent upon coffee exports.
